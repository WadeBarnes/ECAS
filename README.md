# ECAS
Ministry of Education Electronic Contract Administration System (ECAS)

## Features
ECAS has been implemented using MS Dynamics on-Premise with a user portal developed in PHP (V7.1), OpenShift, vue.js (V2.5), Laravel Framework(V5.8), .Net Core (v 2.1).

The application includes the ability to set up a proposal, in this case a session. Applicants can create a profile and apply to be part of the session.  Ministry staff will evaluate the appropriateness of the applicant and invite those suitable to attend the session.  Those that accept the invitation receive a contract for the services requested.

The Ministry will be developing, in phase 2, the ability for the applicants to submit expenses.

Key to phase 2 is the integration with the Corporate Accounting System.
